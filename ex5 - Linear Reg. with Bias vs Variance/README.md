In this exercise, we will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

In the first half of the exercise, we will implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

In the next half, we will go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias v.s variance.
