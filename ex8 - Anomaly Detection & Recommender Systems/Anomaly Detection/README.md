In this exercise, we will implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server.

We will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in our dataset. After that, we will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions.
